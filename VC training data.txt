Basics of Venture Capital:
________________________________________
1. What Do VCs Do?
•	Role of VCs: Venture capitalists (VCs) provide financial support to startups and early-stage companies that have high growth potential but also involve significant risk. They offer not just capital but also mentorship, strategic guidance, and connections to help these companies succeed.
•	Investment Process:
o	Sourcing: VCs find potential investment opportunities through networking, pitch events, referrals, and direct outreach.
o	Due Diligence: They perform thorough checks on the startup’s business model, market potential, financials, team, and legal aspects to assess the viability and risks of the investment.
o	Investment Decision: Based on their analysis, VCs decide whether to invest in the company, typically in exchange for equity (ownership stake).
o	Post-Investment Support: After investing, VCs often take an active role in the business, joining the board of directors, advising the founders, and leveraging their networks to help the company grow.

2. How Do VCs Make Money?
•	Equity Ownership:
o	VCs receive equity in the companies they invest in, meaning they own a portion of the business. The value of this equity can increase significantly if the company performs well and grows in value.
•	Exit Strategies:
o	Initial Public Offering (IPO): When a company goes public, shares are offered to the general public, allowing VCs to sell their stake at a potentially much higher price than their initial investment.
o	Acquisition: If a startup is acquired by another company, VCs can sell their equity, often at a premium.
o	Secondary Sale: VCs may sell their shares to other investors or funds before an IPO or acquisition, realizing gains earlier.
•	Carried Interest and Management Fees:
o	Carried Interest: This is a share of the profits (typically around 20%) that VCs receive from their investments, paid after the investors get their initial capital back.
o	Management Fees: VCs charge a management fee (usually 2% of the fund size) to cover operational costs, regardless of investment performance.

3. Why Do VCs Invest in Startups?
•	High Growth Potential:
o	Startups, especially in technology, biotech, and other innovative sectors, have the potential for exponential growth. VCs are attracted to these high-risk, high-reward opportunities because of the possibility of significant returns.
•	Diversification:
o	Investing in a portfolio of startups allows VCs to spread risk. While many startups may fail, a few successful investments can generate large enough returns to compensate for the losses.
•	Market Disruption:
o	VCs seek to invest in companies that can disrupt existing industries or create entirely new markets. Disruptive companies often have the potential to dominate their market niche, providing substantial returns.
•	Supporting Innovation:
o	VCs are often passionate about supporting innovation and entrepreneurship. Investing in startups allows them to be at the forefront of new technologies and business models.
